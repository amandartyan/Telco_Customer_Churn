# Telco Customer Churn EDA and Prediction 

This project aims to gain insight from each data through exploratory data analysis and find out about customer churn through predictions by machine learning models. 

The dataset includes information about:

-Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
-Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
-Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
-Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
